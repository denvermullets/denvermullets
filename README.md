### About Me
Hi Iâ€™m Ryan, a software engineer, [designer ](https://www.denvermullets.com/video) and [photographer](https://www.denvermullets.com/). I have a long history with being involved with coding, starting when I was about 11 yrs old. A friend introduced me to QBasic and the help docs so with nothing but time on my hands I started making my own games and apps. From there I moved on to Visual Basic 3.0 and was able to make a couple of apps for family members.

Over the past few years I kept dipping my toes back into coding as something to do for fun and after I realized that I wanted to learn the concepts seriously I decided to quit my job and enroll (and graduate!) from a coding bootcamp, Flatiron School.

I love working with React, Javascript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about photography and design and truly believe that learning never stops.
