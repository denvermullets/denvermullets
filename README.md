### About Me
Hi Iâ€™m Ryan, a software engineer, [designer](https://www.denvermullets.com/video) and [photographer](https://www.denvermullets.com/). I have a long history with being involved with coding, starting when I was about 11 yrs old. A friend introduced me to QBasic and the help docs so with nothing but time on my hands I started making my own games and apps. From there I moved on to Visual Basic 3.0 and was able to make a couple of apps for family members.

I switched careers from a Design oriented role in Jan 2020 and have loved my time in code. Over the past year I've been working for a small early stage startup where I've been able to rapidly grow and expand my knowledge. I love working with React, Typescript and/or Javascript, Node.js, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about photography and design and truly believe that learning never stops.
