## About Me: 
Iâ€™m Ryan Vaznis, a software engineer, designer and photographer. I have a long history with being involved with coding, starting when I was about 11 yrs old. A friend introduced me to QBasic and the help docs so with nothing but time on my hands I started making my own games and apps. From there I moved on to Visual Basic 3.0 and was able to make a couple of apps for my dad to use in his day to day. Thereâ€™s a few apps I have vivid memories of making and for a while my source code lived on the internet as I was as active as a 12yr old can be on the old VBcode forums.

Over the past few years I kept dipping my toes back into coding as something to do for fun and after I realized that a lot of walkthrough videos focus mainly on executing their vision of whatever the app is without teaching you the â€˜whyâ€™, I decided to quit my job and enroll (and graduate!) from a coding bootcamp - Flatiron School.

I love working with React, Javascript, and Ruby / Rails. I'm passionate about photography and design and truly believe that learning never stops.
